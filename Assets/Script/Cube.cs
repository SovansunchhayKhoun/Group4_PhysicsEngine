/** 
    Project: (Similar to rocket league) that consists of:
    - A player driving a car
        - Able to apply some physics on the car's wheels
    - Has some ramps (maybe)
    - A goal net
    - Some random cars (bots) driving around the field
    - If the player's car bump with the bot car -> crash/game over
    - If the player hits the ball, it bounces
    - The ball has a sprint joint -> drop on start
    - If the ball enters the goal net -> gain a score
